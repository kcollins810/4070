This game is essentially asteroids where the objective of the game is to shoot the 
"asteroids"--which are giant 0s and 1s. If a 0 or 1 hits your "ship--which is a mouse 
cursor--then you will lose a life. You start with three lifes. When you shoot and hit 
a 0 or a 1, they will split into smaller 0's and 1's. Each time you clear the field of 
0s and 1s, you enter the next level where more 0s and 1s will spawn. Losing all three 
of your lives will result in a game over. The graphics--including the text--are all 
done using vectors. The cursor ship is animated with a flame when you are moving it 
and is able to rotate. The 0s and 1s are freely rotating around the canvas. Scoring 
works when you successfully hit and destroy a 0 or 1.

To play the game, simply, press spacebar to begin and use spacebar to shoot and the 
arrow keys to move your cursor ship around. Spacebar is used to respawn your cursor 
ship if you are hit.
